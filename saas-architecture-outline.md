# SaaS Site Health Monitoring - Basic Architecture

## 1. Core Components

### 1.1 Backend Server
- Language: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- Responsibilities:
  - User authentication and management
  - Website management (add, edit, delete monitored sites)
  - API endpoints for frontend and monitoring service
  - Alert generation and distribution

### 1.2 Database
- Type: PostgreSQL
- Stores:
  - User accounts
  - Monitored websites
  - Monitoring configurations
  - Historical monitoring data

### 1.3 Monitoring Service
- Separate microservice
- Responsibilities:
  - Periodic health checks
  - Performance metric collection
  - Data processing and analysis

### 1.4 Frontend
- Single Page Application (SPA)
- Framework: React.js
- Features:
  - User dashboard
  - Website management interface
  - Real-time status updates
  - Alert configuration

### 1.5 Message Queue
- Technology: Redis or RabbitMQ
- Purpose: Decouple monitoring service from alert generation

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Monitoring
- Uptime checking (availability)
- Performance metrics (response time, load time)
- Custom check intervals

### 2.2 Alerting
- Multi-channel support (starting with email)
- Real-time notifications
- Customizable alert thresholds

### 2.3 User Management
- Multi-tenant architecture
- User authentication and authorization

### 2.4 Reporting
- Historical data visualization
- Customizable dashboards

## 3. Deployment
- Cloud provider: AWS or Google Cloud Platform
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (for scalability)

## 4. Future Considerations
- Additional alert channels (SMS, Slack, etc.)
- Advanced monitoring features (SSL expiry, content changes)
- Integration with popular third-party services
